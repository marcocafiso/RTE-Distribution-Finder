### Input parameters for the simulation:
## Parameters description
# WTs_distribution_list = choose the WTs distribution (0 = Exponential WTs distribution, 1 = Power-Law WTs distribution, 2 = Uniform WTs distribution)
# Ts = sampling time of the simulation
# perc_sigma2 = noise percentage variance with respect signal variance (set number between 0 and 1) 
# average_noise = noise mean
# alpha = parameter for the alpha-function as impulse response (set at [NaN] if you want to use the other impulse response)
# gamma = parameter for the underdumped oscillator function as impulse response (must be > 1 and < 2*omega_0)
# omega_0_min_list = set min of omega_0 for the underdumped oscillator function as impulse response (must be > 1 and > gamma/2)
# omega_0_max_list = set max of omega_0 for the underdumped oscillator function as impulse response
# amp_impulses = a list with two numbers that define the minimum and maximum amplitudes for the impulses
# n_impulse = number of impulses 
# r_p = parameter for Exp distribution (set at 1)
# mu = parameter for power-law distribution (number between 1.5 and 3)
# tau = mean WTs (set at 1) (power-law WTs distribution)
# seed_values = set the values of the seed for the random generators
